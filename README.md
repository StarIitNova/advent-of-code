# Advent of Code

These are all of the files I used to complete Advent of Code, currently only containing 2024, (part of) 2023, and (part of) 2015. When I get around to it, I will complete the previous years of Advent of Code.

To respect this repository, please do not steal my answers, instead you may use them to learn from (or translate into other languages, but make sure you understand what these scripts do). The core.h file in source/ along with the tools folder are free of use, just make sure you credit me (and the person who made the MD5 script) in your projects. The documentation for the core.h file will be rewritten after I complete AoC 2024.

Want to test any of these files or don't understand how I obtain the input? The test.bat and test.sh files allow for easy testing.
First setup the directory by navigating to the setup folder and then running whichever script for your operating system, then navigate back to the top level directory and simply run:

```batch
test 2024/day1p1
```

For unix systems, run:

```bash
$ ./test.sh 2024/day1p1
```

replace the 2024/day1p1 with whichever file you want (without the .cpp extension).
Note that you place your input in a file named `input.txt`, as per Advent of Code copyright I cannot sync my input.txt file to github, although to add one place it in the same folder as this readme.
